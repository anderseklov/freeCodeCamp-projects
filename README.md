# freeCodeCamp-projects
Personal projects for courses in web design, development and tech at freeCodeCamp.org.

This repository serves my personal projects only and **I will not be merging any pull requests**. Mainly for image hosting and reference. All code written by hand by myself. You may take any code you find useful for anything you want to create and consider this Public Domain.
