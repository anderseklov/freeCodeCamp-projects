								<p class="lead">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small
									and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript
									can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
									JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core
									set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
								</p>

								<p>Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

								<ul>
									<li>
										Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
										For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
										mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
									</li>
									<li>
										Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
										server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation
										to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Servers, shells and environments</h2>

								<p>JavaScript can also run inside of a shell in your operating system. For instance, macOS comes with a integrated JavaScript shell,
								called <code>jsc</code>. On Linux there are similar ones, such as rhino. But the most usual interactive shell and back-end JavaScript tool
								today is <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>, used for the majority of servers, micro-services, APIs and even desktop and mobile apps.

								<p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

								<p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

								<p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

							<p class="lead">Writing your first lines of code</p>
					        <article>
								<p>In order to write and execute JavaScript code you will need a text editor and a project folder to
									put files related to your furst coding project in. You can alternatively use an online educational environment
									such as <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">codepen</a> or <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/" target="_blank">jsfiddle</a>.
									Therse are the easiest sites to get started writing your first pieces of JavaScript.
								</p>

								<p>In your first JavaScript document (your-file.js) or if you are using JSFiddle.net
									(<em>make sure you use the setting 'JavaScript + No-Library (pure JS)'</em>), write these two simple lines and press 'run' (or save and refresh your browser):
								</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<pre>var name = "John Doe"; <br>var alert_text = "Hello, " + name;<br>alert(alert_text);</pre>
								</div>
					        </article>
					    </section>

					    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
					        <header>Variables</header>
							<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
							</p>
							<p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
								Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
								(lowercase).
							</p>

							<p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters
								in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

							<p>In your first JavaScript document (your-file.js) or if you are using JSFiddle.net

					    <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
					        <header>Declaring variables</header>
					        <article>
								<p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
									<br><br>
									With the keyword var. For example,
								</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<pre>var x = 42;</pre>
								</div>

								<p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
								<p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<pre>x = 42;</pre>
								</div>

								<p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
								<p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<pre>let y = 13.</pre>
								</div>

								<p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
					        </article>
					    </section>

					    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
					        <header>Variable scope</header>
					        <article>
								<p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document.
									When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
								</p>

								<p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope)
									that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared,
									not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<pre>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</pre>
								</div>
								<p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015, commonly referred to as ES6.</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<pre>if (true) { <br>    let y = 5; <br>} <br>console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</pre>
								</div>
					        </article>
					    </section>

					    <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
					        <header>Global variables</header>
					        <article>
								<p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window,
									so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
								<p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example,
									if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
					        </article>
					    </section>

					    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
					        <header>Constants</header>
					        <article>
								<p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a
									letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>


								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<pre>const PI = 3.14;</pre>
								</div>

								<p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
								<p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
								<p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<pre>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR <br>function f() {}; <br><br>const f = 5; // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO <br><br>function f() { <br>    const g = 5; <br>    var g; // statements <br>} </pre>
								</div>

								<br>
								<p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<pre>const MY_OBJECT = { <br>    "key": "value" <br>}; <br>MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</pre>
								</div>

					        <header>Data types</header>
					        <article>
					            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
					            <ul>
					                <li>
					                    <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
					                    <ul>
					                        <li><strong>Boolean</strong>. <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</li>
					                        <li>
					                            <code>null</code>. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
					                            JavaScript is case-sensitive, <code>null</code> is <em>not the same</em> as <code>Null</code>,
					                            <code>NULL</code>, or any other variant.
					                        </li>
					                        <li>
					                            <code>undefined</code>. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
					                        </li>
					                        <li><strong>Number</strong>. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
					                        <li><strong>String</strong>. "Howdy"</li>
					                        <li>
					                            <strong>Symbol</strong> (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
					                            are <em>unique and immutable</em>.
					                        </li>
					                    </ul>
					                </li>

					                <li><code>Object</code>. A data type that lets you structure multiple key/value pairs into one single data type.
										Objects can include keys with values that are strings, numbers or any other of the previously mentioned
										primitive data types. A value of an <code>Object</code>'s key can also be another <code>Object</code>.
										<strong>Arrays</strong> are also <strong>Objects</strong> but with different syntax.
									</li>
					            </ul>
					            <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
					            you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
					            functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
					            think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
					            procedures that your application can perform.</p>

					    <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
					        <header>if...else statement</header>
					        <article>
					            <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
					            true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
					            condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<pre> if (condition) { <br>    statement_1; <br>} else { <br>    statement_2; <br>} </pre>
								</div>

					            <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
					            Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
					            condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
					            statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
					            statement, including further nested if statements.</p>

					            <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
					                conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<code>if (condition_1 == here we are) { <br>    statement_1; <br>} else if (condition_2) { <br>    statement_2; <br>} else if (condition_n) { <br>    statement_n; <br>} else { <br>    statement_last; <br>} </code>
								</div>

					            <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
					            which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
					            statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
					            general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
					            when nesting if statements:</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<code>if (condition) { <br>    statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true; <br>    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; <br>} else { <br>    statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false; <br>    statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; <br>}</code>
								</div>

					            <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
					            expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
					            glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
					            <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use
					            an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
					            additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<code>if ((x = y)) { <br>    /* statements here */ <br>}</code>
								</div>
					        </article>
					    </section>
					    <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
					        <header>while statement</header>
					        <article>
					            <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
					            condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>

					            <p><code>while (condition) { /* do something here */ }</code>.</p>

								<p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
					            the statement following the loop.</p>

					            <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
					                If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
					                condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
					                stops and control is passed to the statement following while. </p>

					            <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement <code>({ ... })</code> to
					                group those statements.</p>

					            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

					            <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

								<div class="code-wrapper">
									<code>var n = 0; <br>var x = 0; <br><br>while (n &lt; 3) { <br><br>    x += n; <br><br>    n++; <br>}</code>
								</div>

					            <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
					                Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
								</p>

					            <ul>
					                <li>After the first pass: <code>n = 1</code> and <code>x = 1</code></li>
					                <li>After the second pass: <code>n = 2</code> and <code>x = 3</code></li>
					                <li>After the third pass: <code>n = 3</code> and <code>x = 6</code></li>
					            </ul>
					            <p>
					                After completing the third pass, the condition <code>n &lt; 3</code> is no longer
					                <code>true</code>, so the loop terminates.
					            </p>

					        <article>
					            <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
					            statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>

					            <ul>
					                <li>The name of the function.</li>
					                <li>
					                    A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
					                    separated by commas.

					                <li>

					            </ul>
					            <p>
					                For example, the following code defines a simple function named

								</div>
					            <p>
					                The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
					                consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
					                function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The <code>return</code>
					                statement specifies the value <strong>returned</strong> by the function.

					            <code>return number * number;</code>
					            <p>
					                Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
					                value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
					                changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
					                globally or in the calling function.

									This document contains information/documentation of the JavaScript programming language, taken from an assigment
									specification HTML document, which I have altered in both HTML markup and meta-tag structure as well as content texture.
									The documentation on this page was in part changed to accomodate better language, but not in it's meaning or educational contexts.
									All the origial documentation from that assigments demo page was taken from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide" target="_blank">MDN</a>.
									The accuracy of the documentation is not precise and may vary in its quality.
