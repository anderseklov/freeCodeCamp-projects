                        better known as Héctor Lavoe, was a Puerto Rican salsa singer.</li>

                        <li>The artist Héctor Lavoe, born Héctor Juan Pérez Martínez 30 September 1946,
                        was a Puerto Rican salsa singer and song writer.</li>

                        <li>He moved to New York City on 3 May 1963, at the age of sixteen.
                        Shortly after his arrival, he worked as the singer in a sextet
                        formed by Roberto García. During this period, he performed with
                        several other groups, including Orquesta New York, Kako All-Stars,
                        and Johnny Pacheco's band.</li>

                        <li>In 1967, Lavoe <strong>joined Willie Colón's band as its <em>vocalist</em></strong>, recording
                        several hit songs, including "El Malo" and "Canto a Borinquen".</li>


                        <li>In 1973, Lavoe was given the opportunity to become the bandleader of <strong>his own orchestra</strong>.
                        He and his band traveled the world on their own, and he would also be a guest singer with
                        the Fania All-Stars for several shows.</li>

                        <li>In Lavoe's solo album discography you can find releases such as <strong>La Voz</strong> (1975), <strong>De Ti Depende</strong> (1976),
                        where you can hear the hit "El Periodico de ayer", and <strong>Que Sentimiento</strong> (1981).</li>

                        <li>Lavoe's recording of Tite Curet Alonso's "<strong>El Periódico de Ayer</strong>" was a
                        number one hit on Mexican charts for four straight months. It was also a
                        strong hit in several Caribbean countries and South America.</li>
